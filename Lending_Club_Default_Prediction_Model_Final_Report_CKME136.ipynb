    "# Lending Club - Loan Repayment Prediction Model - Final Report\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "The goal of each and every business is to make profit.  For a lender profit depends on whether or not the borrower repays the principal as well as interest.  Without repayment the lender will incur a loss and that loss can even potentially be greater than the initial loan amount when lawyer, court and collection fees are taken into consideration.  Therefore, it is critically important for a lender to be able to identify whether a potential borrower can and will make all of his or her loan payments.  The purpose of this project is to identify the characteristics (limited to those found in the dataset) of persons who are likely to default on their loans and provide a simple framework for borrowers to make such a distinction.  In order to make predictions on which potential borrower is or isn’t likely to default, binary classification predictive models will be created using a variety of machine learning algorithms.  The framework for lenders to make predictions concerning potential borrowers will come in the form of a decision tree.  "

    "**Benchmarking state-of-the-art classification algorithms for credit scoring: A ten-year update**\n",
    "\n",
    "http://www.business-school.ed.ac.uk/waf/crc_archive/2013/42.pdf\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially this paper is a modern update to the landmark benchmarking study of classification algorithms for credit scoring by Baesens, Van Gestel, Viaene, Stepanova, Suykens and Vanthienen in 2003.  Since 2003 many new techniques and algorithms have been developed in predictive modeling.  This paper builds upon Baesens et al. by including all of the newer state-of-the-art techniques as well as those covered in the previous study.\n",
    "I chose this paper because its goal of comparing of classification algorithms for credit scoring is highly related to the problem this project aims to solve.  The paper describes a vector x of m dimensions with each dimension as a feature characterizing an application for a credit products such as a loan.  It then goes on to discuss a binary response variable which indicates the existence or non-existence of a default event.  The probability of a default event given x is the classification problem being addressed in the study.  Finally, a decision maker will take this probability and if it falls under a given threshold the application will be accepted, otherwise it will be rejected.  This is essentially the approach I am taking for this capstone project.  The Lending Club data set I am using for this project contains over 100 features characterizing the borrower, my vector x.  The data set also contains a feature stating the current status of the loan with various possible values that can easily be grouped into default or non-default statuses.  This is effectively my binary response variable described in the study.  Finally my goal is to estimate the probability of default given a set of borrower characteristics and use that to determine whether they are likely or unlikely to default.  Again, this is parallel to the study.\n",

    "The following table measures the performance of each algorithm in credit scoring classification using Area Under a ROC Curve (AUC).

    "This study compares the performance of eight machine learning algorithms namely, SVMs, neural nets, logistic regression, naïve bayes, memory based learning, random forests, decision trees, bagged trees, boosted trees, and boosted stumps.  The performance metrics used are, accuracy, F-score, Lift, ROC Area, average precision, squared error and cross entropy.  The study concludes that bagged trees, random forests and neural nets have the best average performance (prior to calibration) over all the metrics and over all the problems.  When calibration is taken into account, the overall best performing algorithm is boosted decision trees (calibrated).  In close second is Random forests, followed by bagged decision trees (uncalibrated). \n",

    "**Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "I was fascinated to discover that from both of the studies I researched, ensemble methods were generally the best performers.  I was also pleasantly surprised to find that in both studies, the top three performing algorithms were almost identical.  According to Benchmarking state-of-the-art classification algorithms for credit scoring: A ten-year update, the top three classifiers were Random Forests, Bagged (MLP) Neural Networks, and Bagged Decision Trees.  Meanwhile according to An Empirical Comparison of Supervised Learning Algorithms, the top three are Boosted Decision Trees, Random Forests and Bagged Decision Trees. In both studies Random Forests and Bagged Decision Trees come out on top.  It’s important to note that An Empirical Comparison of Supervised Learning Algorithms did not include Bagged Neural Networks.  Given the agreement among both studies I have decided to use Random Forests, Bagged (MLP) Neural Networks, and Bagged Decision Trees for this project.  \n",
    "In addition to selecting classification algorithms, metrics for measuring the performance of said algorithms are required.  Given the similarities of the goals of my project and the aims of Benchmarking state-of-the-art classification algorithms for credit scoring: A ten-year update, I have decided to use some of its performance measures.  Specifically, Percentage Correctly Classified (PCC), and the area under a ROC curve (AUC).\n"

    "From looking at the variables, intuitively I would guess the following should be significant:\n",
    "1. int_rate: Interest rate\n",
    "2. emp_length: Employment length in years. The longer the period of employment the more stable the income.\n",
    "3. loan_amnt: The loan amount. The larger the loan the more difficult to pay off. \n",
    "4. annual_inc: Annual income. \n",
    "5. delinq_2yrs: The number of 30+ days past-due incidences of delinquency in the borrower's credit file for the past 2 years. This gives some insight as to the borrower's reliability.\n",
    "6. fico_range_low: The lower boundary range the borrower’s last FICO pulled belongs to. Credit score is very important.\n",
    "7. fico_range_high: The upper boundary range the borrower’s last FICO pulled belongs to. Credit score is very important.\n",
    "8. dti: Debt to income ratio. The higher the ratio, the more likely the borrower is to default.\n",
    "9. last_fico_range_high: The upper boundary range the borrower’s last FICO pulled belongs to. \n",

The interesting thing about this feature is that it seems to have a much larger impact on default status than the other low range FICO score (fico_range_low) and all other features examined so far. I imagine this is becuase last_fico_range_low is a more recent FICO score and better reflects the borrowers current financial situation."

    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Load, Cleanse and Balance\n",
    "Load dataset and perform initial cleansing.  Cleansing will entail removing features which only contain NA values, imputing values into features which have a large proportion of NA values, changing feature data types in order to perform correlation analysis. Imputing will be done by populating NA's with the column average. Finally, the dataset will tested for imbalance and corrected if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Feature Selection\n",
    "Determine which features are significant and which will be used in the predictive models. Some feature analysis will be performed in order to understand the data but Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) will be relied upon to determine the optimal feature subset.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Create and Train Model\n",
    "Using the pruned dataset consisting of features determined from steps 1 and 2, create a test and training dataset.  Create predictive models on the training dataset for the following algorithms: Random Forests, Bagged Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Note: Each model is created using the same training dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 4: Make Predictions\n",
    "Use the models on the test dataset and record the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 5: Measure Performance\n",
    "This is a sub-step of step 5.  For each result set in step 5, measure the Percentage Correctly Classified (PCC), the area under a ROC curve (AUC), and accuracy, then compare the performance of each of the classification algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 6: Causes of Default\n",
    "Using the knowledge gained from all of the previous steps, determine the causes of loan default."

    "#### Predictive Models Results Summary\n",
    "Over all of the metrics used, the best performer is Random Forests. The first metric is Percentage Correctly Classified (PCC), which measures the classified loans as a percentage of all loans. The second is Kappa, which is a measure of agreement between two raters. This measure is considered more robust than the others used here. The third is Sensitivity which is the proportion of borrowers who were predicted as not defaulting versus all the borrowers who actually did not default. In other words it measures the success rate of predicting who will not default. The fourth is Specificity which is the proportion of borrowers who were predicted as defaulting versus all the borrowers who did default. This metric is especially important since it captures the success rate of predicting who will default. The final metric is Area Under a ROC Curve which measures the relationship between the true positive rate (TPR) and the false positive rate (FPR). An AUC of 1 means that all borrowers predicted not default did not default in reality. An AUC of 0.5 would indicate that of the borrowers predicted not to default, half actually did while the other half did not."

    "The purpose of this project is to determine the characteristic or features of a borrower and create a framework by which a lender could determine whether a potential borrower is or is not likely to default. The characteristics/features provided above help a lender determine what kind of data he or she needs to compile in order to make a good prediction of default. These features are listed under the **Important Features for Prediction** section above. Once the borrower has gathered all of the data he or she will need a framework to make decisions. The framework provided in this project is the decision tree provided in the **Loan Approval Decision Process** section above. By following the decision and asking each question in regards to a potential borrower, the lender will eventually arrive at general probability of default. In addition to creating a decision porcess for each potential new borrower, the decision tree provides general insights and these can be used for making quick descisions.\n",

    "Overall the best performing classification model was Random Forests.  With an accuracy rate of almost 93%, it can relied upon for consistently accurate predictions. "
